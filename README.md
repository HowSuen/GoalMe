# GoalMe
This is the repository that holds all the code for the Orbital project GoalMe, done by Tan How Suen and Jordan Soh. 

## Project Scope
Our React-Native app provides goal trackers for users to set goals, with specific trackers that cater to three categories: academic, financial, and fitness, that are accompanied by a gamified system and provides data visualisation tools for users to track their progress. 

Users can set goals that are related to their academics, fitness, finance, and more. With the goal trackers, they are able to keep track of which goals they have achieved and which goals are still on the horizon. Achieving goals in the three categories (academic, fitness, and finance) grants the user experience points, which increases their level and grows their avatarâ€™s attributes, such as money. Achievements are also rewarded to the players based on how many goals they achieve, how consistent they are at achieving goals, and more. 
 
In addition, our progress checker provides users a way to visualise their data such as the rate at which they achieve goals, how consistent they are at achieving them, and more. 

## To run the application
Ensure that you have `node`, `npm`, and `expo-cli` installed. 

Pick a local directory and clone this repository with:

`git clone https://github.com/HowSuen/GoalMe.git`.

Once that is done, run `npm install` in the project directory to install the dependencies in this application. 

You can now run the app via `expo start` or `npm start`. A QR code will be generated.  

To use the app on your phone, install Expo Go from the App Store or Play Store first. Then, scan the QR code using your phone, and open it in Expo Go.
