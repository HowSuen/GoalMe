# GoalMe
This is the repository that holds all the code for the Orbital project GoalMe, done by Tan How Suen and Jordan Soh. 

## Motivation
For many students, university is the first time in their lives where they are truly independent, and free to define their own goals and progress. However, the extent of freedom and the multitude of choices students suddenly encounter can be overwhelming, making it hard to set clear goals or find any concrete ways to achieve them.

A habit of goal setting is great for students, as it helps them to concretise and better envision their goals, and in the process provide motivation for them to work towards achieving said goals. Developing this habit can also help us become more productive and makes keeping track of progress much simpler. 

As turning goal-setting into a habit can be daunting or dry to some, we wish to create an app that makes this process fun and rewarding by gamifying it, and employ pretty visuals and charts to keep track of a user’s progress to keep them motivated.

## Project Scope
Our React-Native app, GoalMe, provides goal trackers for users to set goals, with specific trackers that cater to three categories: academic, financial, and fitness, that are accompanied by a gamified system and provides data visualisation tools for users to track their progress. 

Users can set goals that are related to their academics, fitness, finance, and more. With the goal trackers, they are able to keep track of which goals they have achieved and which goals are still on the horizon. Achieving goals grants the user experience points proportional to the goal’s difficulty, which increases their level and grows their avatar’s attributes, such as wisdom. Achievements are also rewarded to the players based on how many goals they achieve, how consistent they are at achieving goals, and more. 
 
In addition, our progress checker provides users a way to visualise their data such as the rate at which they achieve goals, how consistent they are at achieving them, and more. 

## Features
### User Registration and Login System
To use GoalMe, a user will need to create a new account with a valid email, a username and a password longer than 6 characters. They will then be able to log into our app and access more features. 

### Goal Trackers
Our main feature, Goal Tracker, allows users to set their goals, and branches into its children trackers, Academic Tracker, Fitness Tracker, and Finance Tracker. There is also a Completed Goals section for users to view the goals they have achieved. 

### Profile
Registered users are able to access their account profile, which displays their Avatar, email and username. Users are also able to change their username and customise their Avatar.

### Gamified System
Our Gamified System introduces a fun and rewarding way for users to set goals and pursue them. This motivates users to continue pursuing their goals and feel rewarded in the process of working towards their goals, thus ensuring sustainable and prolonged usage of our app.

### Progress Checker
Our Progress Checker provides detailed analysis of the user’s journey in achieving their goals through data visualisation with pleasing aesthetics. It entails data visualisation tools such as pie charts, bar graphs, and line graphs that show users’ progress in completing goals, modules, exercises and savings. Through data visualisations of their progress, users will be able to know the areas they have done well in and their areas of improvement. There are four categories in Progress Checker: Goals, Modules, Exercises, and Savings.
